## Introduction

This is a series of tutorial exercises to familiarize yourself with the basic functions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/)--when working within the [R Studio environment](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

R is free, open-source software and a programming language that can be used for data analysis, visualization, and more. Contributors to R create **packages** that, once installed, will provide you with Virtually any statistical analysis tool you could ever need as an arts education researcher.

The benefit of an open-source software package is that anyone with the requisite programming skill can contribute to its development and it can continually adapt to emerging possibilities.

The programming language can appear opaque at first, but a combination of (a) a little knowledge, (b) practice, and (c) strategic "googling" will eventually allow you to use R for a wide variety of tasks fairly quickly.

## Creating an R Project to Organize your Data Analysis Files

### *R Projects*
The "learning curve" for working with R can at first be fairly steep. Getting started in the R Studio
environment, organizing and accessing files, and even loading a data set for analysis can be tricky obstacles in and of themselves.

Working with **R Projects** in R Studio will help smooth out some of the bumps in the road. Starting an R Project will automatically group all of your files in a single folder/directory and help you avoid problems finding files in R.

|       Setting one up involves the following navigation:
|            File -> "New Project..."
|            Then choose to house your R Project in either a "New Directory," i.e., a new folder or
|            an "Existing Directory," i.e., a folder that already exists on your computer
\
Once you create your R Project directory, you will see that the lower right panel of R Studio shows the directory address you created (or chose) and all of the files in that direcoty. You should save any data files you need for your analyses in the same directory. If you do, it will be easier to load your data and use it later on.

If you don't work from an R Project, you will have to manage the directory designations for your files manually ... and that can cause errors and frustration.

### *R Script*

An **R script** file is where you will create and save the code you write for your projects. 

|       Opening an R script file involves the following navigation:
|            File -> "New File" -> "R Script"  
\
If you are working in an R Project, the new script file will automatically be organized with the rest of your project files.

## Basic Elements of the R Programming Language

### *Calculator Functions*

R can be used as a calculator by entering numbers along with the typical operators:

|    +    Addition
|    -    Subtraction
|    *    Multiplication
|    /    Division
|    ^    Exponentiation
|    You can also use parentheses () for complex operations
\
This is a convenient feature in R that will be useful should you have to transform data or conduct manual computations.

Use the code space below to experiment, click "Run Code" in the upper right to see the output/results:

```{r calculator, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

### *Commenting in Code*
It's usually a good idea to make notes that you can refer to later on so that you will know what your code is trying to accomplish at a later date. You can create commented code by using the number sign symbol "#."

Run the following code and notice how the "commented" bits are in a different color as well as how only the non-commented bits are actually run by R.

```{r commenting, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# This is a comment - it will essentially be ignored by R

4 + 4

# Notice also how this commented operation is ignored by R, that is, not run
# 4 + 4

# The only thing that will result from all of this code is the answer to 4 + 4

```

### *Data Types*

It is important to recognize the **type** of variable you are using when working in R since it will have major implications for the sorts of anlayses you can conduct and whether you will be able to execute your code without errors.

*There are four levels of measurement commonly described in statistics:*

|     interval and ratio â€” what is referred to as "scalar" in SPSS
|     ordinal
|     nominal
\
*R recognizes similar types of variables, but has slightly different distinctions and uses different terminology:*

|     numeric - continuous quantitative values with values following decimal points (10.5, 55.3, 787.0)
|     integer - discrete quantiative values with no decimal values (1, 55, 100)
|     factor - discrete categories with each category called a "level" (an analog to a nominal variable) |     ("cat", "dog", "fish")
|     ordered factor - discrete categories that are ordered (an analogy to an ordinal variable) ("never",
|     "sometimes", "always")
\
*R also recognizes two additional variable types:*

|     character - letters with no additional information attached ("k", "R is exciting", "FALSE", "11.5")
|     - what is referred to as "string" in SPSS
|     logical - TRUE or FALSE Boolean values

## Assigning "Objects" and "Storing" Information in the Global Environment

R can store objects in its **global environment**, that is, it's memory. You will see any objects currently in the global environment in the upper right panel of R Studio. 

Storing objects is simply a matter of assigning information to a name and you can do that using a `<-` symbol. You can then call the name in R or perform operations with the object and the information will be displayed as appropriate. See the following examples in the code below:

```{r assign_variables, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# The lines showing the assignments of numbers to x and y will not result in any output.
# However, R will have stored the values under those designated assignments.
x <- 4
y <- 4

# Each of the following lines will produce output.
x

y

x + y

z <- (x + y)

z/2
```

Many things are typically stored as objects when using R, including: variables, data sets (and any modified data sets you create), outputs of analyses, and custom built functions.

### *Vectors*

You can also assign a collection of values, i.e., a **vector** of values, to an object using the **concatenate** function: `c()`. The following code shows the storage of variables of different data types, *numeric*, *integer*, and *character*. YOu will have to use parentheses when inputting character values.

Note that R will do a pretty good job at guessing what type of data the values in each variable represent when the data is numbers. But, R will typically interpret any vectors that contain letters or words as character variables unless directed otherwise. 

```{r assign_vectors, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# As with the code above, the lines showing the assignments of vectors to each name will not result in any output.
# However, R will have stored the vectors under those designated assignments.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)

integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)

character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")

# Calling the name of each of the vectors will produce output.
numeric_variable

integer_variable

character_variable
```

As with single value assignments, R will also allow you to perform operations with stored vectors (or really any kind of data type). See the following as an example:

```{r operate_vectors, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)

integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)

# Perform vector-based operations

numeric_variable*2

integer_variable/2

```

### *Data frames*
R can store and operate upon all sorts of data objects (values, integers, matrices, and so on). However, the most common object used in statistical analyses is the **dataframe**. A dataframe is R's term for what most would simply call a data set: an arrangement of data with variables as columns and entries as rows.

You can create data frames by assembling vectors of the same length into a single object using the `data.frame()` function. An example of doing this is provided below. 
```{r assign_dataframe, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# First, R will store the vectors under designated assignments.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)

integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)

character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")

# Then you can bind them together into a dataset called "my_data" with three columns (i.e., variables) and 6 rows (i.e., entries).
my_data <- data.frame(numeric_variable, integer_variable, character_variable)

my_data
```

You can also examine a data frame using a variety of different *viewing* functions. See the usage of `head()`: returns the first six rows, `tail()`: returns the last six rows, and `str()`: displays the structure of the data.
```{r view_dataframe, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# First, R will store the vectors under designated assignments.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)

integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)

character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")

# Then you can bind them together into a dataset called "my_data" with three columns (i.e., variables) and 6 rows (i.e., entries).
my_data <- data.frame(numeric_variable, integer_variable, character_variable)

head(my_data)

tail(my_data)

str(my_data)
```

To view a single variable from a dataframe you will need to use an additional symbol the `$` to specify to R that it should search in the particular dataframe the variable is housed in

```{r view_dataframe_select, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# First, R will store the vectors under designated assignments.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)
integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)
character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")
# Then you can bind them together into a dataset called "my_data" with three columns (i.e., variables) and 6 rows (i.e., entries).
my_data <- data.frame(numeric_variable, integer_variable, character_variable)

# Use the "$" to call a single variable wihtin a dataframe
my_data$numeric_variable
```

You may have noticed earlier that when using the `str()` function the three variables in the data frame were summarized as "num" (i.e., numeric) or "chr" (i.e., character). R assumed that "integer_variable" was a numeric variable type even though none of the values had decimal places. It is often necessary to manually tell R what type of data each variable represents. For example, we can specify that "integer_variable" is an integer type variable with the `as.integer()` function and that the "character_variable" is a factor type variable with the `as.factor()` function. We can replace the original variable in the data frame with the new one, now assigned to its specific type, by using an object assignment approach. Alternatively, we could ask for R to create a new variable in the dataframe to represent the newly specified variable while retaining the original. For example:

```{r view_dataframe_specify, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# First, R will store the vectors under designated assignments.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)
integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)
character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")
# Then you can bind them together into a dataset called "my_data" with three columns (i.e., variables) and 6 rows (i.e., entries).
my_data <- data.frame(numeric_variable, integer_variable, character_variable)

# Assign the newly specified variable to the same name as the original to replace it.
my_data$integer_variable <- as.integer(my_data$integer_variable)

# Assign the newly specified variable to a new name to keep the original too.
my_data$character_variable_now_factor <- as.factor(my_data$character_variable)

# View the structure of the data again to see the newly specified variables.
str(my_data)
```
## Base R Functions and Installing and Loading Packages

R comes "preloaded" with many, many functions. That is what is referred to as "base" R. However, you can easily expand the funcitonality of R by installing and using extension packages made by open-source developers in the R community. For beginner R users, this can be somewhat confusing since the combination of base functions with the possibilities of functions from additional packages can offer many ways for conducting any given procedure in R. Often, however, additional packages can make procedures in R more user-friendly. All packages that are available for installing using the typical methods within R are documented on the [R website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Here is an example of downloading a package and loading it for use in R. The [`rstatix`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstatix/index.html) package is intended to make some of the most common statistical analyses that social scientists use simple to execute.

```{r install_load_package, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Simply using the base R install.packages() function will signal to R to find the package online,
# download it, and install it for use in your R system.
install.packages("rstatix")

# To "load" the package, use the base R "library()" function, then all of the functions within the package # # will be available to you. You only need to load a package once during an R session.
library(rstatix)

```

As an example of the convience and functionality that packages offer, consider that it is possible to calculate descriptive statistics for a given variable in R using base functions such as: `mean()`, `sd()`, `range()`, `min()`, `max()`, `mode()`, and so on. But, there are more convenient ways to get all of those summary statistics and more with only one function from other packages. For example, both the `rstatix` package and the `psych` package have a single function

```{r base_rstatix, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# These first lines are just creating the dataframe for this example.
numeric_variable <- c(1.2, 3.7, 5, 2.2, 4.69, 6.123, 10.1, 4.3, 5.5, 6.09)
integer_variable <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 12, 34, 78, 2)
character_variable <- c("who", "what", "when", "who", "what", "when", "who", "what",  "who", "what")
my_data <- data.frame(numeric_variable, integer_variable, character_variable)

# Base R functions for summary statistics
mean(my_data$numeric_variable)
sd(my_data$numeric_variable)
range(my_data$numeric_variable)
min(my_data$numeric_variable)
max(my_data$numeric_variable)
mode(my_data$numeric_variable)

# First "load" the package.
library(rstatix)

# Then use the "get_summary_stats()" function to get a variety of summary statistics
get_summary_stats(my_data, numeric_variable)


```

### *Tidyverse*

The [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) refers to a suite of 8 packages created by a number of developers led by Hadley Wickham that are designed to make various data science tasks more intuitive to do in R. This tutorial will incorporate tidyverse-style coding because it can ease the learning curve when it comes to getting started in R. Some tidyverse packages we will use include (a) ggplot2: , (b) dplyr: , (c) readr: , and (d) haven:. However, we will not have to install and load the packages separately as installing and loading `tidyverse` will set you up with all of them at once.

The **rstatix** package demonstrated above is designed to work seemlessly with other packages in the tidyverse.

### *Lavaan*

The [**Lavaan**](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) package was designed by Yves Rosseel for latent variable analyses such as path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and growth curve models. We will use functions from the Lavaan package when conducting factor analyses.

## Importing and Viewing Various Types of Data Files

Conducting data anlayses in R requires loading your data set (i.e., as an object) into the R Global Environment. Unlike some programs such as SPSS or Excel, there is not a direct data editor associated with R or R Studio. However, there are packages with functions available for reading virtually any type of data file into R.

Four common types of data files you are likely to encounter:

* CSV Files (XXX.csv): "Comma-separated-value" data that can be created in a variety of programs
* Excel Files (XXX.xlsx): Files create in Excel
* SPSS Files (XXX.sav): Data editor files created in SPSS (which can contain a good deal of meta-data, e.g., variable names, value labels, and so on)
* Stata Files (XXX.dta): Data files created in Stata (which can also contain meta-data)
/

The [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package includes a function for importing csv files: `read_csv()`. The [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package has a function for important Excel files: `read_xls()`. The [**haven**](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package includes functions for importing SPSS files: `read_sav()`, and Stata files: `read_dta()`. 

As implied in the bullet list above, some types of data files can be more complex than others. For example, "XXX.csv" files will tend to be very simple, whereas Excel files can have multiple sheets and SPSS or Stata files can come with user-added meta-data. As such, the various functions for reading in different types of data files have many built in options for telling R how to interpret the file. We won't deal with those here, suffice to say it's important to know what's in the file you are reading into R and then checking in came in the way you wanted it to.

The following code demonstrates using functions in the readr package to load each of the data types described above. The data are files included as supplements with the Miksza & Elpus text, [*Design and Analysis for Quantitative Research in Music Education*](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Analysis-Quantitative-Research-Education/dp/0199391904).

Note that this code won't actually run, because importing external files into this tutorial program is too hard for me to figure out how to do.

```{r import_data, eval = FALSE}
# First we will load the packages with the necessary importing functions
library(readr)
library(haven)

# Assuming you are working within an R project and that your data files are in
# the same folder as your project files, importing the data can require very little code.

data_csv <- read_csv("Miksza & Elpus - Chorister data for descriptive analysis examples.csv")

data_SPSS <- read_sav("Miksza & Elpus - Chorister data for descriptive analysis examples.sav")

data_Stata <- read_dta("Miksza & Elpus - Chorister data for descriptive analysis examples.dta")

# Once imported you could use any number of functions to view the data, e.g, head(), tail(), str(), glimpse()

str(data_csv)

```

## Selecting, Filtering, and Altering Variables within Dataframes

In this section, we'll begin to use functions from the **tidyverse** package to demonstrate how to select variables for analysis, filter data according to specific values of a variable, and how to create new variables. More specifically, we we will use the `select()`, `filter()`, and `mutate()` functions from within the package **dplyr**. Given that these functions are from a package within the tidyverse ecosystem, they each can be used with what is referred to as a "*pipe operator*": `%>%`. The pipe operator allows you to write code that can be more intuitive to interpret than using some versions of R base code.

For these exercises, we'll use a dataset provided with this tutorial package called `DescriptiveData`. This dataset contains four variables meant to represent characteristics of hypothetical singers in a choir: (a) age â€” a numeric variable (i.e., ratio measure), (b) years of experience in singing ensembles - an integer variable (i.e., ratio measure), (c) self-reported biological sex at birth - a two-level factor variable (i.e., nominal measure), and (d) rating of their preferred frequency of rehearsing - a five-level ordered factor variable (i.e., ordinal measure). The first six rows of the data are shown below:

```{r show descriptive data, exercise = FALSE, exercise.eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

head(DescriptiveData) %>% kable(align = "c")

```

The following code chunks will demonstrate how to select, filter, and create variables using these data. You can also try each function out yourself.

### *Selecting Variables*

```{r select, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# First we start with the dataframe object then use the pipe to indicate that we
# want to pass the data to the following function, then we call the name of the 
# variable we want to select within the select() function, and then we can call a 
# function that we would like to use to act upon the selected variable - note 
# that you don't need to actually write the name of the variable in the final function.

# This is an example of selecting the "Age" variable and then identifying the
# minimum value (i.e., the youngest age).
DescriptiveData %>% select(Age) %>% min()
```

Use the code space below to try out the select() function and the max() function to
identify the largest number of years of experience in a singing ensemble among the participants:
```{r select_user, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

### *Filtering Data*

```{r filter, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Again, we start with the dataframe object then use the pipe to indicate that we
# want to pass the data to the following function, then we call the name of the 
# variable we want to use to slice our data within the filter() function. 

# You can then continue with another pipe to act upon the filtered data with 
# additional functions, or you could create a new dataset from the filtered data 
# assigning the entire line of code to a newly named object.

# Here is an example of filtering the data so that only those who are 40 years or
# older remain, and then a call of the count() function to show how many of the original 115 # participants are in the newly filtered data.
DescriptiveData %>% filter(Age >= 40) %>% count()

# Here is what it would look like to filter the data as above and then to assign
# newly filtered data to a new dataframe object
DescriptiveData_Filtered <- DescriptiveData %>% filter(Age >= 40)

# You can use the head(), tail(), glimpse(), or str() functions to view the new 
# dataframe titled DescriptiveData_Filtered


# Here is an example of filtering the data so that only those indicating a biological
# sex as Male are in the newly filtered data - note that a quirk in this code is
# that the "equals" operator requires two signs and that when you work with levels
# of factor variables, they need to be presented in quotes and that it is case-sensitive.
DescriptiveData %>% filter(Sex == "Male") %>% count()
```

Use the code space below to try out the filter() function and the count() function 
to filter the data so that only those younger than Age 40 are left in the data, 
then try to filter the data so that only those indicating a biological sex 
as Female are in the newly filtered data:
```{r filter_user, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

### *Creating New Variables with mutate()*

```{r mutate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Once again, we start with the dataframe object then use the pipe to indicate that 
# we want to pass the data to the following function, but, with mutate() we need 
# to specify a name for our new variable and then a formula for how create the 
# new variable.

# The code below creates a new variable named "Age_Months" that is each participants' 
# original Age value multiplied by 12, then the head() function is called so that
# you can see that the new variable is appended to the dataframe.
DescriptiveData %>% mutate(Age_Months = Age*12) %>% head()
# You might have to use the arrow in the upper right of the output box to see
# all the columns, including the new one all the way to the right.
```

Use the code space below to try out the mutate() function and the head() function 
to create a variable that is each participants' age in days:
```{r mutate_user, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

## Basic Descriptive Analyses

### *Summary Statistics*

Creating frequency and crosstabs tables are perhaps two of the most basic and 
fundamental tasks that analysts need to be able to do. The base R functions `table()`
and `prop.table` are good tools for these tasks. The `table()` function will produce 
frequency counts whereas the `proportions()` function will produce cell proportions.

```{r tables1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Since table() is a base R function, we will not use the "pipe" as with 
# functions that work within the tidyverse. Instead, we'll use the dataframe and
# dollar sign approach to choose variables to analyze.

# Here is a code to create a frequency table of the participants' preferred
# rehearsal frequency.
table(DescriptiveData$Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

# We can also assign the entire table to an object to make it easier to work
# with in other functions.
Rehearse_table <- table(DescriptiveData$Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

# The proportions function works with table objects.
proportions(Rehearse_table)

# If the number of decimal places is unwieldy, you can use the base R round()
# function to specify how many places you'd like to see.
round(proportions(Rehearse_table), 2)
```

Here is an example of a cross-tabulation using the same base R functions.

```{r tables2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Here is a code to create a cross-tabulation table of the participants' preferred rehearsal frequency # according to biological sex.
table(DescriptiveData$Sex, DescriptiveData$Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

Bio_Rehearse_Table <- table(DescriptiveData$Sex, DescriptiveData$Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

round(proportions(Bio_Rehearse_Table), 2)
```

You could also request percentages by row by specifying an additional argument 
within the `proportion()` function of "margin = 1" or by column with "margin = 2".

```{r tables3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
Bio_Rehearse_Table <- table(DescriptiveData$Sex, DescriptiveData$Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

round(proportions(Bio_Rehearse_Table, margin = 1), 2)

round(proportions(Bio_Rehearse_Table, margin = 2), 2)
```

As mentioned on earlier pages, the **rstatix** package provides many functions that
make conducting common types of analyses convenient within a tidyverse ecosystem.
The `freq_table()` function can be used in a similar way as the base R `table()` function.
The `freq_table()` function returns frequency counts and percentages (even though
a column is printed that is labeled "prop").

```{r tables_rstatix1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# A line of code using a pipe operator can be used for this.
DescriptiveData %>% freq_table(Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)

DescriptiveData %>% freq_table(Sex, Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)
```

Here is an example of an **rstatix** cross-tabulation with the `freq_table()` function.

```{r tables_rstatix2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# A line of code using a pipe operator can be used for this.
DescriptiveData %>% freq_table(Sex, Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)
```

Examining descriptive statistics of quantitative variables is also a fundamental
step that all analysts will need to take. Such variables can be summarized with the `get_summary_stats()` function from **rstatix**.

```{r summary_stat, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# This code will provide summary statistics for the Age variable.
DescriptiveData %>% get_summary_stats(Age)

# There are additional arguments you could specify if you would like less 
# information. For example, adding "type = common" to the function would yield
# fewer summary statistics.
DescriptiveData %>% get_summary_stats(Age, type = "common")
```

### *Summary Statistics by Sub-Group*

It is also often necessary to summarize data according to sub-groups. The `group_by()`
function from the **dplyr** package can be used for that type of task.
```{r summary_stat_group, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# This code will provide summary statistics for the Age variable broken out by
# participants' reported biological sex
DescriptiveData %>% group_by(Sex) %>% get_summary_stats(Age, type = "common")
```

### **Correlation**

Examining bivariate correlations between variables is also a common analysis 
task. As with all things in R, there are many, many ways to calculate correlation
coefficients in Râ€”and a variety of packages with correlation functions. The
**rstatix** package has several useful functions for calculating correlations.
An additional element of flexibility in all of the rstatix correlation
functions is the ability to specify among several common types of correlation:
Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall.

```{r correlate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# The cor_test() function is quite flexible and intuitive. This code returns
# a Pearson correlation between Age and Years experience in a singing ensemble.
DescriptiveData %>% cor_test(Age, Years.experience.in.singing.ensemble)

# There is also a useful function for creating correlation matrices "cor_mat()".
# Since there are only two interval/ratio level variables in this example
# dataset, it would be inappropriate to demonstrate a Pearson correlation matrix
# of more than two variables.

# It could also be helpful to be able to examine correlations according to
# sub-groups. This code first filters the Sex variable so only those reporting
# are considered in the analyses, then it will result in the Pearson correlation 
# between Age and Years experience in a singing ensemble broken out by participants' 
# reported biological sex.
DescriptiveData %>% filter(Sex == "Male" | Sex == "Female") %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>% cor_test(Age, Years.experience.in.singing.ensemble)

```

## Basic Data Visualization with ggplot2

The graphic capabilities of R are amazing and your options for visualizing data
are vast. In this section, we'll again use the `DescriptiveData` example dataframe
to demonstrate how some of the most common types of graphs. We will continue working
within the **tidyverse** ecosystem and use the extremely flexible package 
**ggplot2**. 

### *ggplot2*

The "gg" in **ggplot2** refers to the "grammar of graphics," which is a reference
to a book by Leland Wilkinson. The primary developer of **tidyverse** packages and 
functions, Hadley Wickham, also developed **ggplot2**. The most basic elements or 
"layers" of a plot rendered with **ggplot2** include: (a) a dataframe, (b) 
the designation of "aesthetics" (e.g., the mapping of variables to aesthetic features), 
and (c) a "geom" (e.g., a shape for the plot such as histogram, boxplot, barchart, 
scatterplot, and so on). From there, there are many options for building additional
layers to the plot and a tremendous amount of flexibility in determining the 
specific look of the features of the plot. When it comes to making beautiful plots, 
there are too many good books and tutorials online that you can learn from. For our
purposes here, we will just make basic (albeit ugly) plots.

The most basic code for plot would look something like this:

* First call the function `ggplot()` and specify the data source:
  + `ggplot(data = your_data)`
* Next, specify which variables from the dataframe are assigned to which axes using the
`aes()` function inside of the `ggplot()` function:
  + `ggplot(data = your_data, aes(x = variable_1))`
  + (There are many more aesthetic possibilities beyond designating axes)
* Next, choose a "geom" to indicate what type of plot you are aiming to make by adding
one of the possible options with a plus sign (`+`) after the `ggplot()` function:
  +`ggplot(data = your_data, aes(x = variable_1)) + geom_histogram()`

### *Histogram*

Creating a histograms is critical for examining the distribution of a quantitative
variable. Here is an example of code for creating a histogram of the Age variable
from the example `DescriptiveData` dataset that follows the generic form described above.

```{r histogram, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Note that the "data =" part of the code was removed since the ggplot() function
# will assume the first argument is the name of the dataframe.
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram()
```

Use the code space below to try and code a histogram for the Years experience in a
singing ensemble variable:

```{r histogram_user, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

### *Boxplot*

Creating a boxplot instead is simply a matter of choosing a different geom. Here 
is an example of code for creating a boxplot of the Age variable.

```{r boxplot1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(x = Age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

You could make it a more typical looking vertical-oriented boxplot by assiging the
Age variable to y instead of x.

```{r boxplot2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(y = Age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Use the code space below to try and code a boxplot for the Years experience in a 
singing ensemble variable:
```{r boxplot_user, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

### *Bar Chart*

Creating bar charts for nominal (i.e., factor in R) or ordinal variables 
(i.e., ordered factor in R) can be done with very similar code. 

```{r barchart, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(x = Preference.for.rehearsal.frequency)) + geom_bar()
```

Creating "stacked" or "dodged" bar charts for two nominal (i.e., factor in R) or ordinal variables 
(i.e., ordered factor in R) would require assigning a second variable to `fill = variable_2` in the `aes()` function and then specifying an additional argument of `position = "stack"` or 
`position = "dodge"` within the `geom_bar()` function.

### *Scatterplot*

Creating scatterplots to depict the relationship between two quantitative variables
will feel similarly intuitive once you get the hang of the grammar of graphics approach.
Here is a scatterplot of the Age and Years experience in a singing ensemble variables.

```{r scatterplot1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(x = Age,
                            y = Years.experience.in.singing.ensemble)) + geom_point()
```

Adding a layer consisting of a line of best fit and the associated standard error
can be done by adding another layer with `geom_smooth()` along with an argument 
specifying a linear model: `method = "lm". (Clearly this is a very weak/non-existent 
correlation!)

```{r scatterplot2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(DescriptiveData, aes(x = Age,
                            y = Years.experience.in.singing.ensemble)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
